#### By _**Michael Petersen**_

## Description

_This project is designed to take a user input of a positive integer and, using looping and arrays, convert numbers containing specific integers (1, 2, and 3) into a text format based on behavior specifications and return an array of numbers and converted text._

## Specifications

| Behavior      | Example Input         | Example Output          |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
|Program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user's inputted number |   "4"   |   "0, 1, 2, 3, 4"   |
|Program converts numbers containing a "1" to "Beep!" | "51" | "Beep!" |
|Program converts numbers containing a "2" to "Boop!" and override previous behavior | "21" | "Boop!" |
Program converts numbers containing a "3" to "Won't you be my neighbor?" and override previous behaviors | "321" | "Won't you be my neighbor?" |
Program returns a range of converted numbers, adhering to previous behaviors | "15" | "0, "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, "Beep!", "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", "Beep!", "Beep!""
